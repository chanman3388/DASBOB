# KEYBOB

36 Key Diodeless Split Choc Keyboard 

Heavily based off the [DASBOB](https://github.com/GroooveBob/DASBOB)

Optimised some of the track layouts. Lines which carry power are now 0.5mm thick.
Extra pads for both nice!nano and Supermini.
There's no buzzer so the pin layout is the same for all microcontrollers.
On/off switch under microcontroller.
Surface mount wire tabs near the bottom for connection to a battery.

Currently untested in any form.
